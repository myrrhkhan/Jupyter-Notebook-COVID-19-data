# Jupyter-Notebook-COVID-19-data

Uses python and the libraries pandas and matplot lib, as well as data from Johns Hopkins, Google, and Apple, to make graphs via Jupyter Notebook
(It's pronounced "Jupiter," not "Ju-PIE-ter," kaifergerstrom.)

Branches:
Johns Hopkins State: analyzes Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data per US state.
Johns Hopkins World: analyzes Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data per country
Google Mobility Data: analyzes Google's Mobility data
Apple Mobility Data: analyzes Apple's Mobility data

There is a link to the Johns Hopkins Repository as a submodule. I've been having a little bit of trouble with the submodules, so bear with me here.
Johns Hopkins official map: coronavirus.jhu.edu Low-key looks inaccurate.
Google Data: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/ Can be downloaded as PDF files or CSV files (as used here).
Apple Data: https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility Can be downloaded as CSV, can't be downloaded as individual PDFs.

To recreate:
Python download located here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Be sure to click "Install PIP Commands" during installation.
To download libraries:
  Open command line, type the following:
    "pip install pandas"
    "pip install matplotlib"
    "pip install jupyter notebook"
    
To open Jupyter Notebook, open command line and type "jupyter notebook". Keep that window open until you are done using Jupyter Notebook.

As of this moment, the Apple and Google mobility data is incomplete.
