Uses python and the libraries pandas and matplot lib, as well as data from Johns Hopkins, Google, and Apple, to make graphs via Jupyter Notebook
(It's pronounced "Jupiter," not "Ju-PIE-ter," kaifergerstrom.)

Branches:
Johns Hopkins State: analyzes Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data per country, accesible using a submodule I created. Also located at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. I've been having a little bit of trouble with the submodules, so bear with me here.
Johns Hopkins official map: coronavirus.jhu.edu.

We (github.com/Team612) did this during a meeting for FRC Team 612 programmers (6 WHAT?!?!?! 612!!!!!!!!)
